Why this matters: All data sources must be reconciled before database lock. Subject with 6
open issues needs data manager to investigate and resolve all 6 mismatches.
FILE 8 GLOBALCODINGREPORT_MEDDRA  The Medical Dictionary Translation
1
MedDRA  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities = international standard for medical
terms.
Column-by-Column Breakdown:
1. MedDRA Coding Report
What it is: Header identifying this as a MedDRA report
Value: Always says "MedDRA Coding Report"
Why: File type identifier
2. Study
Example: "Study 1"
Why: Which trial
3. Dictionary
Example: "MedDRA"
Why: Confirms which coding system is used
4. Dictionary Version Number
Example: "v28.1" MedDRA version 28.1
Simple meaning: Like software version numbers
Why critical: Different versions have different codes. Must document which version was
used for reproducibility.
5. Subject
Example: Subject 47, Subject 80
Why: Which patient's medical terms are being coded
6. Form
What it is: Which form contains the terms to be coded
Possible values:
"Adverse Events" = side effects that happened during study
"Medical History" = pre-existing conditions before study started
"Prior Medications" = drugs patient was taking before joining study
Simple meaning: Where did this medical term come from?
7. Form OID Object Identifier)
What it is: System tracking code for the form
Example: "FORM_AE_001"
Simple meaning: Internal database ID (technical detail, not important for understanding)
8. Logline
What it is: Line number if form has multiple entries
Example: 1, 2, 3
Simple meaning: If patient reported 5 side effects, these would be loglines 15
9. Field OID
What it is: System tracking code for the specific field being coded
Example: "AETERM" Adverse Event Term)
Simple meaning: Technical database reference
10. Supplement Term Value1
What it is: Additional information that helps with coding
Examples:
If main term is "pain", supplement might be "severe" or "mild"
If main term is "rash", supplement might be "itchy" or "red"
Simple meaning: Extra descriptive words
11. Coding Status
Possible values:
"Coded Term" = Translation complete! 
✓
"UnCoded Term" = Still waiting for coder to translate 
Simple meaning: Is this done or still pending?
Why this matters:
"Coded Term" = Good! No further work needed
"UnCoded Term" = Bottleneck! Medical coder needs to process this
12. Require Coding
Possible values:
"Yes" = This term MUST be coded
"No" = Already coded or doesn't need coding
Simple meaning: Does someone need to work on this?
Real-world coding examples:
Example 1 Adverse Event
What doctor wrote: "Patient complained of severe stomach ache after taking pill"
What coder translates to: MedDRA Code 10000081 "Abdominal pain upper" + Severity: Grade 3
Example 2 Medical History
What doctor wrote: "Patient had heart attack 3 years ago"
What coder translates to: MedDRA Code 10001982 "Myocardial infarction"
Example 3 Ambiguous Term
What doctor wrote: "Patient felt dizzy-like"
Problem: Is this "Dizziness" or "Vertigo"? Coder needs clarification → Status: UnCoded
Why MedDRA coding matters:
Different doctors describe same symptom 100 different ways
Computer analysis requires standardized terms
Regulatory agencies require MedDRA coding
Allows cross-study comparisons
FILE 9 GLOBALCODINGREPORT_WHODRUG  The Medicine Name Translator
1
WHODrug = World Health Organization Drug Dictionary = international standard for
medication names.
Column-by-Column Breakdown:
1. WHODrug Coding Report
What it is: Header identifying this as a WHODrug report
Value: Always says "WHODrug Coding Report"
Why: File type identifier
2. Study
Example: "Study 1"
Why: Which trial
3. Dictionary
Example: "WHODrug-Global-B3"
Simple meaning: Which version of the WHO Drug dictionary
Why: Different countries use different drug classification systems
4. Dictionary Version Number
Example: "v202509" September 2025 version)
Why: Drug databases update quarterly with new medications
5. Subject
Example: Subject 62, Subject 96
Why: Which patient's medications are being coded
6. Form
Possible values:
"Antineoplastic Medications" = Cancer treatment drugs
"Prior or Concomitant Medications" = Other drugs patient is taking alongside study
drug
"Medical History - Medications" = Drugs patient took before study
Simple meaning: Which form listed these medications
7. Form OID
What it is: System tracking code (technical detail)
8. Logline
What it is: Line number for multiple medication entries
Simple meaning: If patient takes 8 medications, these are lines 18
9. Field OID
What it is: System tracking code for the field (technical detail)
10. Trade Name
What it is: Brand name of the medication (if provided)
Examples:
"Tylenol" (brand) vs "Acetaminophen" (generic)
"Advil" (brand) vs "Ibuprofen" (generic)
"Lipitor" (brand) vs "Atorvastatin" (generic)
Simple meaning: The commercial product name
11. Coding Status
Possible values:
"Coded Term" = Successfully translated to standard drug code 
✓
"UnCoded Term" = Coder can't figure it out yet 
12. Require Coding
Possible values:
"Yes" = Needs coding
"No" = Already coded or doesn't need coding
Real-world drug coding examples:
Example 1 Brand to Generic
What doctor wrote: "Patient takes Tylenol 500mg twice daily"
What coder translates to: WHO Drug Code X123456 "ACETAMINOPHEN"
Example 2 International Names
What doctor wrote (France): "Paracétamol 500mg"
What coder translates to: WHO Drug Code X123456 "ACETAMINOPHEN"
Same drug, different countries call it different names!
Example 3 Ambiguous Entry
What doctor wrote: "Patient on BP med"
Problem: Which blood pressure medication? Hundreds exist!
Status: UnCoded - coder needs to contact site for clarification
Example 4 Misspelled
What doctor wrote: "Metformin"
What doctor actually meant: "Metformin" (diabetes drug)
Coder must verify spelling and match to correct WHO code
Why WHO Drug coding matters:
Same drug has different brand names in each country
Same chemical has different generic names globally
Need to identify drug interactions across studies
Regulators require standardized drug codes
Analysis: "Did patients taking Drug X have more side effects than those taking Drug Y?"
HOW ALL 9 FILES CONNECT
Think of them as different views of the same reality:
File 1 CPID_EDC_Metrics) = Master Dashboard showing totals
Says "Subject 5 has 19 missing visits"
File 2 Visit Projection Tracker) = Details of those 19 missing visits
Lists each of the 19 visits by name and how overdue each one is
File 1 = Says "Subject 26 has 4 uncoded terms"
File 8 MedDRA or File 9 WHO Drug) = Details of those 4 terms
Lists exactly which 4 medical/drug terms need coding
File 1 = Says "Subject 42 has 1 open EDRR issue"
File 7 Compiled_EDRR = Summary of all EDRR issues
Subject 42 shows 1 open issue in summary
File 1 = Says "Subject 7 has 21 inactivated forms"
File 5 Inactivated Forms) = Details of all 21
Lists each form with reason for inactivation
File 1 = Says "Subject 9 has 38 open queries"
File 1 also has Query Report tab = Details of all 38 queries
Shows who asked the question, what field, how long it's been open
